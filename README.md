# Auto Hot Key Auto Clicker v1

A lightweight Auto Hot Key auto clicker.
Currently only supports Left click

# How to use
- (Ctrl and `) to enable the auto clicker
- (Ctrl and +) to increase CPS
- (Ctrl and -) to decrease CPS
- (Shift and `) to enable randomization
- (Shift and +) to decrease randomization
- (Shift and -) to decrease randomization

Personally I recommend using 11 - 14 cps and randomizaton set to 20 - 25
